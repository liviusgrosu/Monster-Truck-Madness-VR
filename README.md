Monster Truck Madness is a VR off-road driving game

Take control of 3 monster trucks as you collect gold trophies to rack up your score. Watch out though as your truck takes up fuel so be sure to collect some Jerry cans on the way.

## Research:

The purpose of this project is to explore how we interact with virtual controls. In this case a steering wheel, lever, handle, and pedal. 

One of the main issues in VR is the inability to sense feedback from input. This breaks immersion and can leave user frustrated with the experience. In this project we have used X different methods to help mitigate this problem.

1) Increase error deviation

    Increasing the chance a user can successfully interact with an object helps with validating their intended movement. When a system is setup like so, natural movement becomes the bases for how the controls work. In this case, this dramatically decreases the entry of play since we're not asking the user to understand new concepts; let alone one involving their body. 

2) Make controls simple

    Of course there is a pitfall to the just increasing your error deviation and that is that you can't utilized complex controls. What that means is that anything the user needs to perform that is unorthodox to their natural movement becomes a serious challenge. To combat this issue, we need to make controls simple such as creating a simple lever that only goes back and forth


## Controls:

| Actions            | Key                                                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger Button     | Interact with virtual controls                                    |
| Thumb Rest         | Activate selection laser                                          |
| Y Button           | Respawn Car                                                       |
